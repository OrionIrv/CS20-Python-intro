#take 7 temp readings from the user in C or F and send back  the mean and the min/max in all C, K, F
#Functions are important

#1, ask for mesuring system 2, ask for all temps 3, do .sort() 4, print 0 and 6 5, + numbers up and / by list_count
#6, do math to convert to C or F 7, repeat for other measurement 8, repeat for kelvin
